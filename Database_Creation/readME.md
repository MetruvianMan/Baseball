This folder provides code on how to create, maintain, and query databases containing Statcast and MLB API data. Soem of this code was borrowed from tutorials such as Robert Frey (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt0fjUlMvDE) and Down on the Farm (https://downonthefarm.substack.com/p/how-to-getting-minor-league-play).
For ease of use, the code herein leverages the RSQLite package to save databases locally within your RStudio environment. A more convenient long-term solution that takes a bit more time up front is to use the open source software PG Admin to create queryable PostgreSQL databases. Robert Frey has a great explanation video on this found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo73JAsOoUM
